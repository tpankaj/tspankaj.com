    <h1>Tushar Pankaj</h1>

    <p>
      I am a second-year undergraduate electrical engineering and computer sciences major at UC Berkeley.
    </p>

    <p>
      During the school year, I am doing research on autonomous driving with Karl Zipser at the <a href="http://bdd.berkeley.edu">Berkeley DeepDrive</a> lab. I am working on adding a form of memory to the deep convolutional neural networks that drive our cars. During Summer 2017, I am a Software Engineer Intern at Qualcomm in San Diego.

      If you would like to contact me, you can find me at tpankaj (at) berkeley (dot) edu.
