    <h1>Tushar Pankaj</h1>

    <p>
      I am a second-year electrical engineering and computer sciences major at UC Berkeley.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am doing research on autonomous driving with Karl Zipser at the <a href="http://bdd.berkeley.edu">Berkeley DeepDrive</a> lab. I am working on adding a form of memory to the deep convolutional neural networks that drive our cars. I am also the Linux server administrator of the Computer Science Undergraduate Assocation.
